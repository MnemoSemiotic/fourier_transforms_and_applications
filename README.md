These are notes in the form of Jupyter notebooks, from the course videos of EE261, by Professor Brad Osgood at https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=B24BC7956EE040CD

The goal of this series of notebooks is to provide supplemental information and python snippets to students who might be approaching machine learning tasks. Although I am using Professor Osgood's lectures as a template, I am providing links to other video and text resources. In addition, I include python snippets and utility functions for displaying results.
